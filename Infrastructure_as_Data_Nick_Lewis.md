Everyone is on board w/ infrastructure as code, repeatable, documented, revision control etc. 

Config mgmt. is the art of making your monitoring checks pass. 

Abstract what you want from how to do it. 

Resources + relationships = graph of what we want. 

relatipships:
	require
	subscribe (require w/ notify)

Thats kinda poor..

in 3.3 (not out yet), cli flag --ordering manifest|random to set ordering IF relationships are not defined...

Bonus

`puppet describe`
