re-test mcollective (maybe salt IS okay..) (try the puppetdb hooks out)
new foreman install, smart proxies for everything, deployment
migrate puppet repo to private github account
(and dns, and others).
teach everyone puppet describe
hubot
choclaty for windowz
no more direct to master git workflows (dev branch(es), push for aproval (gerrit? github?))
talk about hostname standards. (seriously, enough of this heroXXXXa21b shit).
