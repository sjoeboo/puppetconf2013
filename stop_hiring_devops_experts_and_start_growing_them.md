 the game has changed.

culture
=
cultivations vs colaboration vs competence vs control

you cant hire in cultureal change. 

in a cultivation culture, not just building products and systems and service, but knowledge as well. 

20% time, pairing, not training.  

experimentaion, improvisation. 

not effective:
training
creating a silo of devops
hiring

fragile systems react poorly to stress
resilient systems, not the oppisate of fragilitly. rigid. 
anti-fragile, get stronger w/ stress.

game days: fire drills for DR etc. take backups, dont practice restore? then your backups are worthless. 

what does devops mean? culture change, change the game. grow the people.
